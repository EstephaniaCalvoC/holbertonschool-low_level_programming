### [0. Preprocessor](./0-preprocessor)
* Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.


### [1. Compiler](./1-compiler)
* Script that compiles a C file but does not link.


### [2. Assembler](./2-assembler)
* Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.


### [3. Name](./3-name)
* Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.


### [4. Hello, puts](./4-puts.c)
* C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.


### [5. Hello, printf](./5-printf.c)
* C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.


### [6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](./6-size.c)
* C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.


### [7. What happens when you type gcc main.c](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-happens-when-you-type-gcc-mainc-estephania-calvo-carvajal)
* Blog post that explains all the steps of compilation. Use command lines and examples to illustrate.


### [8. Intel](./100-intel)
* Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

### [UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity](./101-quote.c)
