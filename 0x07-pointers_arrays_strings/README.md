## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What I learned from this project:

* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

---

### [0. memset](./0-memset.c)
* A function that fills memory with a constant byte.


### [1. memcpy](./1-memcpy.c)
* A function that copies memory area.


### [2. strchr](./2-strchr.c)
* A function that locates a character in a string.


### [3. strspn](./3-strspn.c)
* A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.


### [4. strpbrk](./4-strpbrk.c)
* A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.


### [5. strstr](./5-strstr.c)
* A function that locates a substring.


### [6. Chess is mental torture](./7-print_chessboard.c)
* A function that prints the chessboard.


### [7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire](./8-print_diagsums.c)
* A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.


### [8. Double pointer, double fun](./9-set_string.c)
* A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
