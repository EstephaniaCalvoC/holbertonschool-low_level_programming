## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What I learned from this project:

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

---

### [0. What's my name](./0-print_name.c)
* A function that prints a name.


### [1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done](./1-array_iterator.c)
* A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

<!---
### [2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities](./2-int_index.c)
* A function that searches for an integer.


### [3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at](./3-main.c)
* A program that performs simple operations.
